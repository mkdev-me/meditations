      Why is English so important, especially for a programmer? Because almost all the action is in the United States. The biggest IT companies in the world: Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Uber, etc. are all in the United States. Plus, English is an international language. This means that all new technologies and tools are announced in English and their documentation is written in English in the first place.

      The examples are not far to seek. You can see that documentation for any command in the terminal is also in English. Almost everything in the IT industry is in English.
